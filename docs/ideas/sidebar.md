## Research-Based Pain Points Analysis

### Current Industry Pain Points (2025)

**Navigation & Hierarchy Issues:**

- **Progressive Indentation Problems** - Deeper menu items become unreadable due to excessive indentation
- **Poor Feature Discoverability** - Important features hidden behind unclear icons or nested menus
- **Cognitive Overload** - Too many options presented simultaneously (research shows 5-7 items optimal)
- **Navigation Response Problems** - Unresponsive or unpredictable navigation behavior
- **Context Loss** - Users lose track of location in complex hierarchies

**AI Development Tool Specific Issues:**

- **Terminal-First Friction** - Complex tools need streamlined, keyboard-friendly navigation
- **Permission Interruptions** - Constant confirmations break developer flow state
- **Context Switching Overhead** - Moving between views loses AI conversation context
- **Multi-Instance Confusion** - Working with parallel AI sessions becomes disorganized

**Task Management Tool Issues:**

- **Feature Bloat** - Too many options dilute core functionality
- **Information Architecture Problems** - Unclear grouping of related features
- **Mobile/Desktop Inconsistency** - Navigation doesn't adapt well across devices

## Design Principles & Rationale

### 1. Human-Centered Language

**Why It Matters:** Technical jargon creates barriers and makes tools feel impersonal
**Solution:** Use warm, simple language - "Working On" instead of "What I'm Working On", "Done" instead of "Completed"
**Benefit:** Reduces cognitive load, feels approachable, creates emotional comfort

### 2. Immediate Clarity

**Why It Matters:** Users want instant understanding of what they should do next
**Solution:** "Right Now" section at top with clear "Working On" and "Up Next"
**Benefit:** Eliminates decision paralysis, provides instant focus, reduces overwhelm

### 3. Simplified Organization

**Why It Matters:** Too many options create choice paralysis and scanning fatigue
**Solution:** Maximum 2-3 items per section, clear visual hierarchy
**Benefit:** Faster navigation, less cognitive overhead, better user experience

### 4. Meaningful Progress

**Why It Matters:** Users need sense of accomplishment and forward movement
**Solution:** Clear "Done" section and progress-oriented language throughout
**Benefit:** Emotional satisfaction, motivation boost, visible achievement

### 5. Approachable AI Integration

**Why It Matters:** AI features can feel intimidating or overly technical
**Solution:** "AI Helper" with focus on Chat History and simple Assistant Settings
**Benefit:** Makes AI feel like a friendly assistant rather than complex system

### 6. Local-First Simplicity

**Why It Matters:** Complex settings and configurations create barriers to getting started
**Solution:** Simple "Preferences" with just "Project Setup" and "My Settings"
**Benefit:** Easy onboarding, reduced configuration overhead, focus on work

## Implementation Guidelines

### Sidebar Specifications

- **Width:** 280px (optimal for content density and screen real estate)
- **Collapse:** Support for collapsed state showing only icons

- **Theme:** Dark mode optimized with proper contrast ratios

### Visual Design Standards

- **Icons:** Use consistent icon library (Lucide/Heroicons recommended)
- **Typography:** Clear hierarchy with primary/secondary text styles
- **Spacing:** 12px between sections, 8px between items
- **States:** Hover, active, disabled, loading states for all interactive elements

### Interactive Behavior

- **Sections:** Collapsible with persistent state
- **Badges:** Real-time updates for counts and status
- **Search:** Quick filter within sections
- **Drag & Drop:** Support for task reordering where applicable

## Keyboard Shortcuts Reference

### Global Navigation

    done: number;
  };
  currentFocus: {
    hasActiveTask: boolean;
    upNextCount: number;
  };
  documentation: {
    totalFiles: number;
    recentFiles: string[];
  };
  aiHelper: {
    connected: boolean;
    chatCount: number;
