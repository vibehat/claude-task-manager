# Claude Task Manager - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

Claude Task Manager streamlines human-AI collaboration for building software. It gives developers a simple way to direct AI agents, track progress, and ship features using a clean workflow on top of the Task Master CLI. The focus is practical orchestration, clear navigation, and multi-agent support—without requiring special context packages or complex ceremony.

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

- Fragmented workflows and tool switching slow developers down
- Lack of a simple place to direct AI agents and track active work
- Unclear handoffs between human planning and AI execution
- Overhead from complex context handling and setup

## Solution Overview

Provide a focused orchestration layer where developers:

- Set the active work, share concise direction, and oversee progress
- Coordinate multiple AI agents (Claude, Cursor, Copilot) from one place
- Leverage Task Master CLI for task intelligence without extra setup
- Navigate with comfort and clarity using a human-centered UI

No special context packages are required. Keep things lightweight and immediately useful.

## Target Users

### Primary: Individual Developers

- Claude/Cursor users who want faster, clearer workflows
- AI-assisted developers who want a simple orchestration hub
- Flow-focused builders who value minimal ceremony

### Secondary: Small Teams

- Tech leads coordinating agent work
- Startups shipping quickly without process overhead

## Core Features

### 1. Working On – Human Orchestration Center

- Current task focus and clear oversight
- Quick direction input and lightweight handoffs
- Simple progress visibility and quick actions

Success metrics:

- Set and direct the active task in under 30 seconds
- 90%+ of handoffs complete without back-and-forth

### 2. Task Master Foundation Integration

- Uses Task Master CLI for task analysis and operations
- Real-time sync with local tasks and status
- Smart task recommendations from existing CLI capabilities

Success metrics:

- 90% of flows use Task Master actions directly in the UI
- Zero compatibility regressions with the CLI

### 3. Human-Centered Navigation

- "Right Now" for immediate clarity
- "My Work" views for To Do, In Progress, Done
- Simple, friendly language and minimal options

Success metrics:

- New users navigate confidently within 2 minutes
- 95% of actions accessible within 2 clicks

### 4. Multi-Agent Orchestration Hub

- Coordinate Claude, Cursor, Copilot from one interface
- Clear roles and simple task delegation
- Consistent direction shared across agents without extra packaging

Success metrics:

- Seamless direction of 3+ agents without duplicate setup
- Human orchestration effort remains stable as agents scale

### 5. Lightweight Documentation (Optional)

- Capture decisions and outcomes when helpful
- Keep docs practical and close to implementation
- Avoid heavy, auto-generated context mechanisms

Success metrics:

- Docs updated when needed, not as ceremony
- 80%+ of referenced docs remain current

## User Experience Design

### Navigation Structure

```
< Right Now
  Working On (current active task)
  Up Next (prioritized ready tasks)

= My Work
  To Do
  In Progress
  Done

= AI Helper
  Chat History
  Assistant Settings

= Preferences
  Project Setup
  My Settings
```

### Key Design Principles

- Human-centered language
- Immediate clarity of "what should I do now?"
- Minimal clicks to common actions
- Friendly, low-friction UI for long focus sessions

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

**UI Layer (Next.js + React)**

- Feature-based architecture under `/src`
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Responsive, dark-mode optimized UI

**Task Master Integration Layer**

- Full Task Master CLI compatibility and sync
- Task analysis, dependency awareness, and recommendations leveraged from CLI

**Integration Layer**

- CLI wrapper and command execution
- Claude Code MCP and Cursor integrations where useful
- File system and git awareness

**Data Layer**

- Local-first with `.taskmaster/` persistence
- Real-time task synchronization
- Export capabilities for team collaboration

Note: No dedicated "context package" system. Keep integrations simple and pragmatic.

## Success Metrics

### Collaboration Efficiency

- Human → AI handoff setup in <2 minutes without special packaging
- 95% of directions executed without clarification

### Navigation & Usability

- 95% of actions within 2 clicks
- Users report feeling comfortable and in control

### Execution Quality

- Reduced rework from clearer direction and status visibility
- Consistent outcomes across agents without duplicate setup steps

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core (Weeks 1–4)

- Right Now dashboard and Working On flow
- Task Master CLI integration and sync
- Human-centered navigation

### Phase 2: Agents (Weeks 5–8)

- Multi-agent orchestration
- Smart task recommendations via CLI insights
- Quality-of-life improvements and shortcuts

### Phase 3: Collaboration (Weeks 9–12)

- Optional lightweight documentation and decision capture
- Git workflow awareness and branch context (lightweight)
- Team-ready features (shared views, exports)

### Phase 4: Ecosystem (Weeks 13–16)

- VS Code and Cursor extensions
- GitHub Projects sync (optional)
- Deployment options as needed

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical

- CLI dependency changes → maintain strict compatibility
- Performance → scoped data and incremental rendering
- Privacy → local-first by default

### Adoption

- Avoid complexity creep; keep UX simple
- 5-minute onboarding target
- Ship incremental value; avoid big-bang features

## Workflow Scenarios & Use Cases

See `./usecases.md` for example flows (solo dev, multi-agent, quick handoffs, and shipping loops).

## Success Definition

Claude Task Manager succeeds when:

1. Developers can direct AI agents quickly and confidently
2. Handoffs are lightweight and effective—no special context packages needed
3. Multi-agent work stays consistent without duplicate setup
4. The UI makes the next action obvious and fast
