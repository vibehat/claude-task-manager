# Claude Task Manager - Use Cases & Workflow Scenarios

This document outlines detailed use cases and workflow scenarios that demonstrate how Claude Task Manager transforms **solo developer workflows** through seamless human-AI collaboration, context preservation, and intelligent task orchestration.

### Alignment with PRD and Scope

- Phase 1 focus: Right Now dashboard, Working On flow, and Task Master CLI sync.
- Multi-agent orchestration: Phase 2. Examples here are marked optional/future.
- Documentation: Optional and manual-first; automation is future work.
- No special context packages: 'context bundle' means referencing existing PRD, research, tasks, and decisions via Task Master CLI links.
- Agents refer to tools like Claude, Cursor, and Copilot orchestrated from one interface.

## Core Philosophy: Human Strategy + AI Execution = Seamless Collaboration

**FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE**: You focus on product strategy and direction, AI focuses on implementation and execution, with perfect context flow between both.

**The Partnership Model:**

- **You provide**: Vision, requirements, architectural decisions, validation, and strategic direction
- **AI receives**: Complete project context, implementation guidance, patterns, and constraints
- **Context bridges**: Every decision, requirement, mockup, and note flows seamlessly to AI execution
- **Intelligence compounds**: Each collaboration cycle enriches the project knowledge for better future handoffs

This system transforms you from an AI supervisor constantly re-explaining context into an AI collaborator with a thinking partner that understands your project as deeply as you do.
