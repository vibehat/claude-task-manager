# Plan with Context - Context-Aware Implementation Planning

Use this command after analysis to create implementation plans that respect existing architecture.

Usage: `/plan-with-context [implementation request]`

## Context-Driven Planning

**PLANNING REQUEST:** $ARGUMENTS

**PREREQUISITE CHECK:**

- ✓ Codebase analysis completed
- ✓ Existing patterns identified
- ✓ Reuse opportunities evaluated
- ✓ Architecture constraints understood

**IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:**

**1. EXISTING CODE INTEGRATION**

- Files to extend: [list with specific paths]
- Components to reuse: [list with locations]
- Patterns to follow: [document existing patterns]
- Utilities to leverage: [identify reusable functions]

**2. MINIMAL ADDITION APPROACH**

- What truly needs to be new: [justify each new component]
- How new code integrates: [specific integration points]
- Consistency with existing style: [follow established conventions]

**3. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

- File modifications: [specific files and changes]
- New files (if justified): [with exhaustive reasoning]
- API changes: [minimal necessary changes]
- Testing strategy: [leverage existing test patterns]

**4. VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS**

- Architecture consistency maintained
- Existing code reused maximally
- New additions minimized and justified
- Integration points clearly defined

**COMPLIANCE CONFIRMATION:** This plan prioritizes reuse and follows existing architecture patterns.
