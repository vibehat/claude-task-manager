# Analyze First - Codebase Analysis Before Planning

Use this command when you need to analyze the codebase before making any implementation decisions.

Usage: `/analyze-first [feature or area to analyze]`

## Process

COMPLIANCE CONFIRMED: I will prioritize understanding existing architecture before suggesting changes.

**ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:**

1. Map existing file structure relevant to: $ARGUMENTS
2. Identify all related components, services, and utilities
3. Document current patterns and conventions
4. Note any duplicate or similar functionality
5. Highlight extension points and architectural decisions

**DELIVERABLES:**

- Complete file inventory with paths and purposes
- Architecture diagram (text-based)
- Reusability assessment for existing components
- Integration points and dependencies
- Recommendations for extension vs creation

**VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS:**

- ✓ All relevant files identified and read
- ✓ No assumptions about non-existent code
- ✓ Current patterns documented
- ✓ Reuse opportunities highlighted

This analysis will inform all subsequent planning and implementation decisions.
