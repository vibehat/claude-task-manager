# Documentation Reference

This directory contains detailed documentation moved from the main CLAUDE.md to keep it focused and concise.

## Available Documentation

### ðŸ“‹ [Project Overview](./project-overview.md)

- Tech stack details
- Architecture overview
- Directory structure
- Essential commands

### ðŸ”§ [Coding Standards](./coding-standards.md)

- TypeScript standards
- React & Next.js patterns
- Code organization rules
- Performance & quality guidelines
- Project-specific patterns

### ðŸ’¡ [Development Examples](./development-examples.md)

- Working with issues/tasks
- Component patterns
- Adding new features
- Troubleshooting common issues

## Purpose

The main CLAUDE.md file is kept under 60 lines to maximize context efficiency. Detailed documentation is referenced when needed rather than loaded into every session.

## Usage

Claude Code will reference these files when:

- You ask for specific coding patterns or examples
- You need detailed project architecture information
- You encounter issues and need troubleshooting guidance
- You want to understand project conventions in depth

This approach optimizes context usage while maintaining comprehensive documentation accessibility.
