> **Claude Task Manager** is a personal project management interface powered by AI agents that remembers your entire project context. Built on [Claude Task Master](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master), it provides seamless Claude Code project management integration with development tools like Claude Code, Cursor, and VS Code. Perfect for developers and teams who want AI project management that coordinates across their entire workflow.

## The Problem

It's 9 AM. You open your AI coding assistant.

_"So I'm building a..."_

**Stop. You explained this yesterday. And the day before.**

That database decision from last week? Lost in tab #7. The refactoring plan? Gone.

Every AI conversation starts from zero.

## The Solution

**An AI project manager that never forgets**

Beautiful UI layer over the powerful Task Master CLI engine:

**[üìä See complete workflow diagrams ‚Üí](docs/architecture/diagrams.md)**

No more explaining context. No more lost decisions. Just building.

Your vision stays intact from day 1 to launch.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Status: Under Active Development

**We're in the early foundation stage** - building core philosophy, researching UI/UX approaches, and establishing the architectural foundation.

üî¨ **What we're doing now:**

- Defining the vibehat development methodology
- Researching optimal UI patterns for AI-assisted workflows
- Building foundational architecture and components
- Creating comprehensive documentation and mockups

ü§ù **Want to contribute?** We're looking for developers interested in shaping the future of AI development tools:

- Create issues with ideas and feedback
- Check out our research docs: [`docs/prd/main.md`](docs/prd/main.md)
- Explore architecture: [`docs/architecture/diagrams.md`](docs/architecture/diagrams.md)
- Review wireframes: [`docs/wireframes/`](docs/wireframes/)
- See mockups in action: [https://claude-task-manager.vercel.app/](https://claude-task-manager.vercel.app/)

Every contribution helps shape this project. **Early contributors get to influence the core direction.**

## How it works

### Quick start for any project

```bash
# One command to set up everything
npx claude-task-manager init

# Start the UI
npx claude-task-manager start
```

Opens in your browser. That's it.

### What happens:

1. **`init`** ‚Üí Sets up project management skeleton (tasks, docs, config)
2. **`start`** ‚Üí Launches the UI in your browser
3. **Use normally** ‚Üí Claude Task Master CLI still works as usual

### Or try the demo first

```bash
# Clone and run locally
git clone https://github.com/vibehat/claude-task-manager.git
cd claude-task-manager
pnpm install && pnpm dev
```

## What makes this different

**‚ö° Minimal setup, maximum results**  
One command gets you started. From `npx claude-task-manager init` to shipping features in under 2 minutes.

**üéØ Personal productivity ‚Üí Team collaboration**  
Master your own workflow first, then scale to team coordination. Excellence starts with individual mastery.

**üè† Local first, integration ready**  
Your data stays on your machine. Connect to cloud tools when it makes sense, not because you have to.

**üöÄ Ship products, not processes**  
Focus on building things people want. Let AI agents handle implementation details while you drive the vision.

**üí° Smart by default, simple by design**  
Advanced orchestration that feels effortless. Multiple agents coordinate behind the scenes while you stay in flow.

## AI-Powered Development Philosophy

**Seamless AI collaboration.** This tool embraces both traditional flow state development and modern vibe coding approaches. Whether you're doing deep focus coding during quiet hours or using AI to generate code from natural language prompts, we support your workflow.

Most tools break your flow. Context switching kills creativity. But when your AI remembers everything, generates code from your descriptions, and your workspace stays consistent, you can build faster without interruption.

**This is your AI-enhanced development companion.** Built by developers who understand that the best code happens when you're collaborating effectively with AI tools.

### Claude Code Project Management Integration

Perfect Claude Code project management companion:

- **Persistent project context** - Your Claude Code conversations remember your entire project management setup
- **Seamless workflow** - Terminal, tasks, project management, and AI chat in one interface
- **Flow preservation** - No more explaining your architecture or project management decisions every session
- **Focus-optimized** - Dark mode, minimal distractions, maximum project management productivity

## For existing projects

Already have Claude Task Master set up? Just run:

```bash
npx claude-task-manager start
```

The UI will use your existing tasks and configuration.
